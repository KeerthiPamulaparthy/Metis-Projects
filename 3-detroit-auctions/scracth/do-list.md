# McNulty To-Do

All the things to be done between now and the end, including necessary and wish-list items.

## Today

#### Questions needing answers
* What is the date range of the auction set? *June of 2014*
* Is there more data available before the start date? *No, that's when the program began*
* Are the neighborhood names on the auctions DB the same as the ones in the shapefile?
* Is there a way to key into neighborhood name through Detroit data files?

#### Things needing doing
* ~~Build cleaning function and put into module~~
* ~~Build modeling pipeline (copy-paste from challenges 7 & 8 to start) and put into module~~
* ~~Fix column name on auction set in SQL~~
* ~~Viz for money by homebuyer/investor~~
* Animated plot for homebuyer/investor plot by time period? (if time) **30 min max!!! After pipeline...**
* Pull down at least one more data set(s), put into SQL
* Start on some slides (if time)

## Soon
* Tweak neighborhood plot (neighborhood names, blue fill for river, gray fill for non-Detroit, move legend)
* Pull in other datasets from Detroit, Census
* Storyline for slides

## Wish List
* Google API to plot all coffee shops, pet stores, dog parks, etc.
* Figure out how to pull apart shape files (e.g., use freeways, highways, main streets)
* Tie in 5-10 other datasets
