# Metis Projects
I am in the process of moving all five of the projects I completed during the Metis data science boot camp into this folder for the sake of organization. Until all are tucked neatly into this one, the following will link to their current repositories:
* [Project 1: MTA Turnstile Data Exercise](https://github.com/davidluther/Proj-01-Benson)
* [Project 2: Delays Expected](https://github.com/davidluther/Proj-02-Luther)
* [Project 3: Predicting DLBA Auction Purchaser Type](https://github.com/davidluther/Proj-03-McNulty)
* [Project 4: Themes of Social Awareness in Lyrics, 1965-1975](https://github.com/davidluther/04-fletcher)
* [Project 5: Saxophone Detector](https://github.com/davidluther/Sax-Detector)
