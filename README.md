# Metis Projects
This folder houses all code and supplemental materials for projects completed while attending the Metis data science bootcamp.

### Project 5 (Kojak): Saxophone Detector
Using PyTorch, built a convolutional neural net to detect the presence of saxophone in an audio clip. Also built and hosted a web app to label audio samples using Flask and JavaScript in an effort to create my own dataset.

### Project 4 (Fletcher): Say It Loud
Used NLP, topic modeling, and clustering to tease out themes of social awareness in the lyrics of the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 from 1965-1975. Also built a basic recommender to find songs similar to songs containing these themes.

### Project 3 (McNulty): Detroit Auction Purchaser Prediction
Built a classification model to predict whether a winning bidder of a Detroit Land Bank Authority auction would be a homebuyer or investor. Data sourced from Detroitâ€™s Open Data Portal (Socrata) and stored using a PostgreSQL server for access on an AWS instance.

### Project 2 (Luther): Delays Expected
Built a linear regression model to predict lateness of flights between New York Laguardia and Chicago O'Hare. Scraped all data with BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

### Project 1 (Benson): MTA Turnstile Data
An exercise in exploratory data analysis and cleaning, doing pushups with pandas to analyze and leverage the traffic flow through the turnstiles of New York's subway system.
