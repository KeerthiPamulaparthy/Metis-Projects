# Metis Projects
I am in the process of moving all five of the projects completed during the Metis data science boot camp into this folder for the sake of organization.

### Available Here

#### Project 1 (Benson): MTA Turnstile Data
An exercise in exploratory data analysis and cleaning, doing pushups with pandas to analyze and leverage the traffic flow through the turnstiles of New York's subway system.

#### Project 2 (Luther): Delays Expected
Built a linear regression model to predict lateness of flights between New York Laguardia and Chicago O'Hare. Scraped all data with BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

#### Project 5 (Kojak): Saxophone Detector
Using PyTorch, built a convolutional neural net to detect the presence of saxophone in an audio clip. Also built and hosted a web app to label audio samples using Flask and JavaScript in an effort to create my own dataset.
